This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where unexpected behavior occurs when no route matches the current URL.  The problem arises from omitting a catch-all route (`/*`). Without it, if the URL doesn't exactly match defined routes, React Router may not render anything or render a previous component unexpectedly. This example shows how to fix this by adding a catch-all route.
